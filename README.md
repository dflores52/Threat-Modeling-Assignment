# Threat-Modeling-Assignment
A sample web app for threat modeling practice
## Overview

This repository contains a minimal sample web application designed to support a threat modeling assignment. The application's core features include:

- A login page where users enter a username and password
- Use of an open-source component to authenticate users against a database
- Display of a message-of-the-day (MOTD) for authenticated users
- Capability for users to comment on the MOTD (comments are stored in the database)

This project serves as a foundation for analyzing and identifying security threats using frameworks such as STRIDE.
